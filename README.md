# ZMK-keymap-viewer
This is a MacOS app that lives in your menu bar and shows your current ZMK keymap.
It is completely vibe coded with Github Copilot

Styling is still very early stage, but functionality should be somewhat servicable.

Due to difficulties with the file picker I went with a textentry field to the path of your Keymap.
