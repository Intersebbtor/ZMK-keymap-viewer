## A lightweight macOS menu bar app that displays your ZMK keymap bindings in a visual 2D grid. Perfect for when you're learning a new layer or can't remember where you put that special key.

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Download (Recommended)

1. Go to [**Releases**](../../releases/latest)
2. Download `ZMK-Keymap-Viewer.dmg`
3. Open the DMG and drag **ZMK Keymap Viewer** to your Applications folder
4. **First launch:** Right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog
5. After that, launch normally from Applications or Spotlight

> **Why right-click?** The app isn't notarized with Apple, so macOS shows a warning. Right-click → Open bypasses this for apps you trust.

### Option 2: Build from Source

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools and Swift 5.9+.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sebietter/ZMK-keymap-viewer.git
cd ZMK-keymap-viewer

# Build release binary
swift build -c release

# Run directly
.build/release/ZMKKeymapViewer

# Or create an app bundle
mkdir -p "ZMK Keymap Viewer.app/Contents/MacOS"
cp .build/release/ZMKKeymapViewer "ZMK Keymap Viewer.app/Contents/MacOS/"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Click the ⌨️ icon** in your menu bar
2. **Paste the full path** to your `.keymap` file and click **Load**  
   (e.g., `/Users/you/zmk-config/config/cradio.keymap`)
3. **Click a layer tab** to view that layer's bindings
4. **Hover over keys** to see the raw ZMK binding code
5. **Done!** Your keymap is now always one click away

### Tips

- Use **Recent** dropdown to quickly switch between keymaps
- Click **Open in Editor** to jump to your keymap file
- Press **Enter** after pasting a path to load immediately
- The app **auto-loads** your last keymap when you reopen it

## ⌨️ Supported Keyboards

Auto-detects layout based on key count:

| Keys | Layout |
|------|--------|
| 34 | Sweep, Cradio, Ferris |
| 42 | Corne, Crkbd |
| Other | Generic split layout |

> insert your keymap and tell me how it went :)

> **Want better support for your keyboard?** Open an issue with your layout details!

## 🛠️ How It Works

The app parses your `.keymap` file and extracts:
- All layers defined in the `keymap {}` block
- Bindings like `&kp`, `&lt`, `&mt`, `&trans`, `&bt`, and custom behaviors
- Layer names from comments (e.g., `// Base` or `/* Num */`)

It then displays them in a visual grid matching your keyboard's physical layout.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome! Some ideas:

- [ ] Improve visualization for Combos / Shortcuts
- [ ] Parse combos and macros
- [ ] Export layout as image
- [ ] Live file watching for auto-reload
- [ ] Support for Windows and Linux
- [ ] Support for QMK on top of ZMK
- [ ] File picker for keymap insertion (could not get this to run, hence the file path solution)
- [ ] Alias to show what shortcuts acutally do --> e.g. &kp LS(LA(2)) //€

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This tool was generated almost entirely by AI** (GitHub Copilot / Claude). While it works for me, you should treat it with the appropriate level of suspicion you'd give any AI-generated code. Use at your own risk, review the code if you're paranoid (you should be), and don't blame the robots when things go sideways.
